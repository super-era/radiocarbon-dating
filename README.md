# radiocarbondating.py

## What does this program do?
This python program asks the user for the percentage of carbon-14 remaining in their sample.  It then calculates the estimated age of the sample based on the C14 percentage, converts this to the Common Era year format, and returns both outputs to the terminal. This was created during Code in Place 2021, using concepts up to and including Lesson 5.

## How to run this project

Download the .zip file from github and extract to a suitable folder. Open radiocarbondating.py in Visual Studio Code. Use the command

to initialise the project, and follow the terminal prompts to use this program.

## Concepts this project uses
- asking for user input with input()
- initialising variables of different types and converting between them as needed
- importing and using the math library in Python
- using basic operations in Python
- printing to the terminal with print()
- function creation, parameters and returning output to the main function

## Change log
